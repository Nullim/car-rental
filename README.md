# Car Rental

## Introduction

CRUD made in Node.js to create, read, update and delete cars, users and reservations.

## How to use

To correctly run the application locally, you must follow these steps:
- Clone the repo
- Once you've cloned the repo, run 'npm install' to install dependencies. If this doesn't work, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- Create an '.env' file on the project root, based on the contents of '.env.dist' located in the same folder
- To run the server, run the command 'npm run nodemon' on the terminal to start the app through Nodemon.
- Visit the URL indicated by the console (by default: http://localhost:3000)
